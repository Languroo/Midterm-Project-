 <h1>Loopy Model</h1>
     <p>
     This "loppy"(Embed this later) model showcases how our project will make a difference on the issue by showing plastic flowing into our oceans via a plastic disposal container, and as it flows down into the water innocent wildlife will either flee there habitat or and unlucky few will stay and face the consequences.

 <h1>Storyboard</h1>
    <p>For our storyboard it follows our protagonist, the Ocean, who is going through there day normally until suddenly our antagonist pops up, Plastic Waste. These two draw parallels towards each other as one is benevolent and caring whilst the other is toxic and harmful to all those around it. These two pieces are the crux of our narrative structure and animation strucuture as the piece is focused on both of these two.
